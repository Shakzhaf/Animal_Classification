# Animal_Classification
This convolutional neural network obtained state-of-the-art performance at object recognition on the CIFAR-10 image dataset in 2015. We will build this model using Keras, a high-level neural network application programming interface (API) that supports both Theano and Tensorflow backends. You can use either backend; however, I will be using Theano.
